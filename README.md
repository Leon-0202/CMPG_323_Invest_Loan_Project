# CMPG_323_Invest_Loan_Project - Development
Repository for Homework 1 &amp; 2 for CMPG 323.

The problem to solve was to create an application for a semester project with real life application.
The application had to meet the following requirements:
* Panels, Layout managers and Menus
* Inheritance â€“ at least 4 classes in a hierarchy
* Arrays
* Exception Handling
* Polymorphism
* Array lists 
* File i/o

The GUI had to be coded with javax.swing; no IDE could be used to create the GUI.

I designed an application that creates objects of investments and loans, and allows them to be stored, modified, and deleted.
Polymorphism is used to determine method implementation between different types of investments and loans.
